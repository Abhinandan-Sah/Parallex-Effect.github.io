                Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders. Paragliders are lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like ‘pod’ suspended below a fabric wing.
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.
